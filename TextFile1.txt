Until now i realised 2 files:
1. HTMLTree5.html. This file contains code for Tree diagram  presentation. I think that for its distribution its licence should be checked.
2. ScriptHASH.js. Contains code for SHA256 hash calculation. Needs Node.js package and code in Command Prompt '> node  ScriptHASH.js'. 
i think that i can connect cryptohash and Merkle Tree diagram presentation until deadline.
